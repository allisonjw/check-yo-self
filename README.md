# CHECK YO' SELF Module One - Project Four

## **Turing School of Software and Design**
**Allison Wagner**
**Front End Program**


## **Learning Goals:**
Solidify and demonstrate your use of:
+ semantic HTML
+ clean & organized CSS styles
+ DRY JavaScript
+ localStorage to persist data
+ Iterate through/filter dom elements using for loops/array prototype methods
+ Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
+ Ability to match/recreate a UI and create a great UX

Created a task management webiste that allows you to check items done, mark tasks urgent, and remove cards 
once tasks have been completed. You are also able to filter through urgent tasks, search through tasks that have been made.
